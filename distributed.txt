Plan for running this project using distributed computing:

None of the operations in this system are very operationally heavy--instead of breaking down individual
tasks into multiple pieces, distribution could make sense from a bandwidth perspective. The databases
for users and appointments could be separated and hosted on different machines on different networks,
making each of the processes more efficient. This is obviously not very useful at the small scale of
this demo, but if a system like this were potentially handling thousands of users and appointments, it
could be smart to host them separately.

Alternatively, distribution can offer a layer of redundancy. Separate databases on different machines can
hold the same information, backing up periodically, to prevent massive data losses in the event of a
failure. However, this benefit should be balanced with the fact that additional storage locations offer
additional points of entry for adversaries. A breach becomes more feasible with every additional
redundancy.
